## The files attached are the Matlab scripts that were necessary to analyse the data and plot the figures.

## For the OFF period and ON period analyses, we have uploaded the relevant data files that were generated using the OFF period detection (OFFAD) algorithm, also available on GitHub (https://github.com/sjoh4302/OFFAD) - details in this paper: https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-023-00780-w 

## Raw and pre-processed (sleep-scoring) files of the recordings being very large, if those are requested for futher analyses, please email vladyslav.vyazovskiy@dpag.ox.ac.uk
